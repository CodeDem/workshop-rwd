## Responsive Web Design Workshop Files

These are all the code files for my Responsive Web Design workshops. It's set up as a self-contained site, and contains begin/end/working versions so you can work along with each section and know where you should end up.

This is a major refactoring from my 2013 and earlier workshops, so I'm still going back through some of the IE compatibility issues but generally speaking it is quite broadly compatibly. 

I'm not using any CSS pre-processing (which would certainly make it easier) so you can get the most hands-on experience.

### Browser Compatibility

With some final tweaking needed, the code is resonsive in IE6+ (yes, really), FF 3.6+ and all major current browsers.
