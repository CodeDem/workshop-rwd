## Responsive Web Design Workshop Files

These are all the code files for my Responsive Web Design workshops. It's set up as a self-contained site, and contains begin/end/working versions so you can work along with each section and know where you should end up.  

This is a major refactoring from my 2013 and earlier workshops, so I'm still going back through some of the IE compatibility issues but generally speaking it is quite broadly compatibly.   

I'm not using any CSS pre-processing (which would certainly make it easier) so you can get the most hands-on experience.  

### Browser Compatibility

I firmly believe that the point of RWD is to be inclusive, so these files are meant to work on just about anything - even IE6. Yes, I said it. Really.  

###Currently tested:

####Mac OS
> Safari  
> Chrome  
> Firefox  

####Windows
> Win7 / IE9  
> Win7 / IE10  
> XP / IE 6-8 (works but needs some love)  

####Mobile
> iOS  
> Android
